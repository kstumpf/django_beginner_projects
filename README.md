django_beginner_projects
========================

My first steps learning Django.
This Repository consists of two basic Django projects, titled "mysite" and "microblog".

mysite follows the <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.6/intro/tutorial01/">Official Django Tutorial</a> step by step to create a basic poll application.

microblog follows the second and third lessons of <a href="http://gettingstartedwithdjango.com/en/lessons/microblog-kitchen-sink/">Getting Started With Django</a>, an online tutorial by Kenneth Love.

<h3>Installation and Configuration</h3>
Download the .zip file located to the right. From the command line, enter one of the two projects and sync the database by typing the following: 
    python manage.py syncdb 
Then run the server with: 
    python manage.py runserver

This project runs with:
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">Python 2.7.8</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/download/">Django 1.5.0</a></li>
</ul>
